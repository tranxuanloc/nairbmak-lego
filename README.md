# Kambria Lego

Each component will be like a piece of lego. Each has its own color, shape & function. But they're all tidy, well designed and can be easily connected to each other. It's all about our creativity to build stuff.

Lego use [ESLint] (https://eslint.org/) with config from [eslint-config-react-app] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app) used by Create React App  
[How and why to use ESLint] (https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/why-and-how-to-use-eslint-in-your-project-742d0bc61ed7)

### Git commit hook
This is to run eslint check before every commit. If it doesn't pass eslint check, it will fail to commit  
`cp .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit`  
Open .git/hooks/pre-commit, go to the end of the file and edit like this:

`set -e
npm run pretest
// If there are whitespace errors, print the offending file names and fail.
exec git diff-index --check --cached $against --`  

Now it will run `eslint --ignore-path .eslintignore .` every time you commit  
You can run that command manually anytime by this shortcut `npm run pretest`  
Or ask eslint to run auto fix with `npm run pretest -- --fix`
